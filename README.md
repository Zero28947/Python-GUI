# Python-GUI

To make the python GUI works first is you need to store all the files in a single file
Afterwards put all the images in a single file name image
Then put all the gifs in a single file name gif
Finally you can use the code provided

Note: It's recommended to firstly run the splash as this connects to the main menu which is the project.py
      and the project.py will connect you to the three python file recursion, linked_list, and stack
      You are also able to go back to the previous window by clicking the back window

-Melvin: Try mo gawing images yung mga nodes sa linked list pwede mo ibase sa practice_linked_list.py

-Pajo: Try mo gawing images yung stack pwede mo ibase sa practice_stack.py
